#Acknowledgments

Thank you to our classmates and instructors at the Flatiron School in New York, New York. We'd especially like to thank Truman and Garry for allowing us to pitch our ideas to them. Also thank you to the ascii artists who worked tirelessly to provide us with this flawless presidential portrait. A final thank you to Matz for creating such a lovely language to play with.
